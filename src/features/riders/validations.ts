/**
 * One schema for both modes — `requiresAccount` is the only thing that differs.
 *
 * This used to be a `createRiderSchema` / `updateRiderSchema` pair, and keeping
 * them unified is what makes a single `useForm` possible: react-hook-form types
 * the resolver against the form's value type, so two schemas with different
 * key sets (or different optionality) cannot both be passed to one form without
 * a cast. Deriving the second schema from the first only moved the problem to
 * the value types, so the mode difference is expressed where it actually lives —
 * in a refinement — rather than in the shape.
 *
 * Create provisions a backing user row, so it needs credentials. Update is one
 * combined PATCH against an existing account: the email is read-only in the UI
 * and credentials are never sent. Defaults for status/vehicleType
 * mirror CreateRiderDto (@default ACTIVE / BIKE) rather than being
 * invented here.
 *
 * Format and length are validated unconditionally (they are free to check, and
 * a blank string is accepted so the field is not permanently red while the user
 * is still typing); only *presence* is mode-dependent.
