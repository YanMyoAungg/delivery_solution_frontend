/**
 * One schema for create and edit.
 *
 * These used to be two schemas over two value types, which forced the two-mode
 * branch and a cast at every access. They are now one `UserValues` shape with
 * both mode-specific keys always present, and each mode constrains only the key
 * it actually renders:
 *
 * - `password` — create renders it and requires the length rules; edit has no
 *   password field at all, so the value stays `''` and `toUpdateUserBody` omits
 *   it. Pinning it to `z.literal('')` in edit mode means a stale value can never
 *   sneak into a PATCH even if the field is rendered again later.
 * - `status` — edit renders it; create does not, and the backend defaults a new
 *   account to ACTIVE, so `toCreateUserBody` omits it. It stays required in the
 *   schema because the form always holds a valid default, which keeps the
 *   inferred type a plain `UserStatusValue` instead of `| undefined`.
